## Running Application
Run "make graph" in terminal to bring up our application. 

Clicking on the green circle toggles underneath the images will determine whether 
that tile is used in the rendered map or not. Green means it will be used and 
grey means it will not.

There are also two menus on either side of the red generate button. The left menu
controls what size the resulting map will be while the right menu controls which
tiles are available to be used. 

Clicking the red generate button will render the map based on the chosen tiles. 
If no tiles are selected, an error message will appear on screen.

You can also clear the map by pressing the space bar.
